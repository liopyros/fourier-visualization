# fourier-visualization

I used Python to recreate a really interesting visualization of Fourier series approximations, showing how they're made up of a series of wave functions added together. This particular function on the right (blue) is an approximation of a square wave (green), and is the result of the motions of all four "arms" on the left (black). A larger number of arms would do a better job in approximating the square wave, though the left-hand side would be much more complicated and harder to see!

This representation has intrigued me ever since I first saw it featured in a SmarterEveryDay video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds0cmAV-Yek), which referenced this original blog post, written in Turkish: https://bilimneguzellan.net/fuyye-serisi/
