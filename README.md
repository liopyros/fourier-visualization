# fourier-visualization

I used Python to recreate a really interesting visualization of Fourier series approximations, showing how they're made up of a series of wave functions added together. This particular script looks to approximate a square wave. Upon running, the user will be asked how many approximation terms should be used (hint: start at 1 and go to 3, 5, 7... see the blog post below for more information). The user will see that the function (blue) is an approximation of a square wave (green), and is the result of the motions of all four approximating terms, or "arms" on the left (black). A larger number of arms will do a better job in approximating the square wave.

This representation has intrigued me ever since I first saw it featured in a SmarterEveryDay video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds0cmAV-Yek), which referenced this original blog post, written in Turkish: https://bilimneguzellan.net/fuyye-serisi/
